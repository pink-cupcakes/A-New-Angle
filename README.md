# Forum---a-new-angle

## Introdution
Welcome to Form - a new angle. We have enjoyed the benefits of living in the Information Age, but sometimes that presents another problem - too much information. At Form, we believe that human responses will always be specifically tailored to our situation and easier to understand. So take a spin - take a look at questions our community has asked. You can get involved with the community by answering posts or upvoting questions which helped you or you just thought were funny!

## Getting started :raised_hands:

Before getting started with the project, make sure you have the latest version of git and npm installed on your computer.

To start your application you need to clone this repository here:
https://github.com/pinkwaffles/A-New-Angle

- Then in your terminal, navigate to the project and run:

    `npm install`

    This pulls all the dependencies from package.json and installs them.

- If you wish to access a dev environment, run the following in your terminal:

    `npm install -g live-server`
    `live-server`

    This will automatically open a dev environment in which you can see changes to the code being updated live. It servers the same function as nodemon would in node.

- If you wish to access a user interface, just open index.html:

    `open index.html`
