# Forum: An angular view

## Introdution
Welcome to Form - a new angle. :tada::tada: We have enjoyed the benefits of living in the Information Age, but sometimes that presents another problem - too much information. At Form, we believe that human responses will always be specifically tailored to our situation and easier to understand.

So take a spin - take a look at questions our community has asked. You can get involved with the community by answering posts or upvoting questions which helped you or you just thought were funny! :smiley:

## Getting started :raised_hands:

Requirements:

- git version >= 2.7.1
- npm >= 5.6.0

Instructions:

1. Clone this repo:

   https://github.com/pinkwaffles/A-New-Angle

2. Then in your terminal, navigate to the project and run:

    `npm install`

    This pulls all the dependencies from package.json and installs them.

3. To access the user interface, just open index.html:

    `open index.html`

    To access the dev environment, run the following in your terminal:

    `npm install -g live-server`

    `live-server`

    This will automatically open a dev environment in which you can see changes to the code being updated live. It servers the same function as nodemon would in node.
