# Forum---a-new-angle

## Introdution
Welcome to Form - a new angle. We have enjoyed the benefits of living in the Information Age, but sometimes that presents another problem - too much information. At Form, we believe that human responses will always be specifically tailored to our situation and easier to understand. So take a spin - take a look at questions our community has asked. You can get involved with the community by answering posts or upvoting questions which helped you or you just thought were funny!

## Getting started

To start your application you need to clone this repository here:
https://github.com/pinkwaffles/A-New-Angle

Then in your terminal, navigate to the project and run:

`npm install`

This pulls all the dependencies from package.json and installs them.
